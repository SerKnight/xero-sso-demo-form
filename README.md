This is a basic application showing how to use the [xero-ruby](https://github.com/XeroAPI/xero-ruby) sdk and the OAuth2.0 and OpenID Connect flow to pre-populate a signup form.

# Signup with Xero

As more small business apps join Xero's marketplace we have found a huge signup conversion boost for apps create, and subsequently login with their Xero account.

Full docs on that here:

[Sign In with Xero](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/oauth2/sign-in)

However SSO does not always work with an app's infrastructure or their on-boarding process might start with booking a demo, instead of immediately starting a free-trial.

Because Xero leverages OA2 and OpenID Connect we can use the decoded `id_token` to prefill user details, and the `access_token` to make a few API calls the pre-populate dynamic signup details.

Using jsut a few lines of code, we can pre-populate the following fields from Xero's API which makes a great user experience versus dropping someone on a blank landing page.

* given_name
* family_name
* email
* org_name
* contacts_count
* currency
* timezone
* street
* city
* postal_code
* phone
* password
